# Solidus Comments

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio-contrib/solidus_comments.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio-contrib/solidus_comments)

Solidus Comments is an extension for Solidus to allow commenting on different models via the
admin ui and currently supports Orders & Shipments.

Solidus Comments also supports optional comment Types which can be defined per comment-able
object (i.e. Order, Shipment, etc) via the admin Configuration tab.

This is based on a fork / rename of jderrett/spree-order-comments, and subsequently spree/spree-comments

Notes:

* Comments are create-only.  You cannot edit or remove them from the Admin UI.

## Installation

Add the following to your Gemfile (or check Versionfile for Solidus versions requirements):

    gem "solidus_comments"

Run:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rails g solidus_comments:install
```

Run the migrations if you did not during the installation generator:

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

Start your server:

    rails s

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_shipstation/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusComments::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions
